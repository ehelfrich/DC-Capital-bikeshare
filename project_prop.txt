Question: How do riders with membership compare with riders without?

Impact: How to improve membership numbers.

1. Compare number of rides between mem and non-member
2. Compare mean/median length of time and distance_data
3. See what stations are the most popular for mem and non-membership
4. See how time day affects # of rides/time/distance_data
5. See how time of day affects population locations


Compare mem/non-member and commuting Trips
Origins and destinations
membership types of commuting trips and non-commuting


mixture models classifications

Project
1. Figure out how to classify commuter vs member_casual
  a. Gaussian Mixture Model
  b. Binning rides based off of time -very easy
2. Land use data
  a. Figure out how to map lat/long to the dataset
  b. How draw polygons around common land use areas in ARCGIS and then export as geoJSON
3.

**Story**
How does rider membership impact the use of the bike share system for commuting and non-commuting?


How does ridership change based on membership?
- Layered histogram with Time on X axis and swap-able y axis
  - Y could be: # of rides,
- Swap time between hourly of 1 day and daily view of 1 year

How do commuting patterns change based on membership?


Does membership change the area that users start their rides?


# What to do
Eric - GMM, or Binning
Ling/Panick - See if you can draw polygons in arcGIS and then export as geoJSON
All - Come up with visualizations for the last 2 questions (or come up with new questions)

How does rider membership impact the use of the bike share system for commuting and non-commuting?

How does ridership change based on membership?
  - layered histogram with distance of ride grouped by membership
    - data headers (group(hour), Member, Non-Member)
  - layered histogram with total time of ride grouped by membership
    - data headers (group(hour), Member, Non-Member)

How do commuting patterns change based on membership?
- 2 heat maps side by side that are split between membership (start location)
- 2 heat maps side by side that are split between membership (END location)
  - button swaps between morning and evening commute


- do the  histogram again, but just for commuting times
  - Have member and nonmember side by side in the histogram

Does membership change the area that users start their rides?
- chord graph between land use clusters
- pair with histogram of lines
